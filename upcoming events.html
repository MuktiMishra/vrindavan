The god Vishnu, for whom ekadashis are sacred, is believed to reside in the tree. The amla tree is ritually worshiped on this day to get the grace of the deity. The day marks the beginning of the main celebrations of the festival of Holi, the Hindu festival of colours.

The observer of the vrata should have a ritual bath in the morning. The devotee or priests ceremonially bathe and water the tree and then worship it with a puja ritual. Devotees fast on this day and gifts are offered to Brahmin priests praying for prosperity, wealth and health. Devotees also listen to the vrata katha of Amalaka Ekadashi.[9] Offering of food and charity is prescribed on this day; the virtue is equated to the performance of a vajapeya, a somayajna sacrifice.<br>

Though the festival of Holi begins on Vasant Panchami, it is on Amalaka Ekadashi that the main festivities begin. The day marks the beginning of the climax of Holi, culminating on four lunar days later on the full moon. From this day, people start playing with colours.<br><br><br>

According to Hindu scriptures Holika Dahan, which is also known as Holika Deepak or Chhoti Holi, should be done during Pradosh Kaal (which starts after sunset) while Purnimasi Tithi is prevailing. Bhadra prevails during first half of Purnimasi Tithi and all good work should be avoided when Bhadra prevails.<BR>


In VRINDAVAN even today a panda (priest) Holika emerges from the middle of the burning Holi on the combustion, but it does not burn fire. This tradition has been practiced here for centuries by the Panda family of Falain. People from all over the world reach to see it. A fair is organized in the village. People are painting their homes to welcome the visitors.<BR>

For this tradition played during Holika Dahan, a member of the Panda family who has to come out of the burning Holi, leaves home a month ago and stays in the temple. While staying there, he worships, chants and fasts. Only after this Holika Dahan takes place.<BR><br><br>

Chaitra shukla pratipada, i.e. the day following holika dahan is known as Dhulendi. In fact, this is the day when holi is played all over the country. Holi celebrations reach a peak on this day in Vrindavan as well as in the temple on this day. By tradition Bihariji does not play Holi on this day rather He only watches the devotees playing Holi.<br>

These five days thakurji is adorned in spotless white dress which turns into all colors by the end of Darshan period.Color is extracted by boiling the flowers of tesu in water and this naturally colored warm water with a pleasant fragrance is sprinled on the devotees by the priests. A number of other scented materials like sandal paste, itr (sandal wood oil based natural perfumes), and rosewater are also distributed. Dry colored natural powders (chemical free) in silver, gold, red, green, yellow, purple etc are used in plenty so that the interiors of temple remain colorful throughout.

Holi is celebrated for over five days in the temple with full fervor. Symbolic Holi celebrations start from the Basant Panchami day (Magh Shukla Panchami, Saraswati Pooja). From this day onwards gulal, dry red colour, becomes integral part of the shringar. The cheeks and the chin of Bihariji are decorated with gulal. This appearance of Thakurji tastefully designed dresses in bright colors like red, yellow, green, purple, golden, with intricate zari, strings of pearls in banki pag (zigzag turban ) on head, crowns of various design with peacock feathers,

 that big bindi on the forehead, those big shining eyes with familiar notorious twinkle, earrings hanging on cheeks, besar (nose ornament) precariously balancing on that beautiful sharp nose, that bewitching smile on lips, red color generously smeared on the cheeks and chin competing with rubies, necklace, garlands, bracelets, armlets, waistband every ornament in its place is simply fascinating, specially charming and inviting- come, let us play Holi. Full scale holi celebrations start from evening of Aanwla Ekadashi (Falgun Shukla Ekadashi) and continue till Holika Dahan day (Falgun Shukla Poornima). During this period a silver hut is erected in the jagmohan and Thakurji occupies that. Thus He is much closer to devotees or easily accessible to communicate and develop relationship.
